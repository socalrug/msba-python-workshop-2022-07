### Friday July 29: Applied Data Science Fundamentals with `pandas`

The focus will be on Pandas as the entry into data science specific tasks, drawing from the getting started tutorials: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/index.html

* Session 5: Introduction to `pandas`
    * Why tabular data tables are useful for data science (compare to Excel)

    * How to create Series and DataFrames
    * How to read Series and DataFrames from files
* Session 6: Subsetting `DataFrames`
    * Selecting columns
    * Filtering rows

* Session 7: Reshaping and Merging `DataFrames`
    * Wide vs. long formats and converting between the two: pivot and melt
    * Grouped summaries, `groupby`
    * Concatenating tables by column and row: `concat`
    * Joining data tables: `merge`
* Session 8: Data Visualization with `pandas`
    * Basic plotting from pandas: `plot`, `scatter`, `box`, `hist`, etc
    * Examples of more complex plots, coloring and grouping by variables
    * Tuning plot parameters (sizes, colors, layouts)
    * Saving plots (e.g. to use in presentations, etc)
