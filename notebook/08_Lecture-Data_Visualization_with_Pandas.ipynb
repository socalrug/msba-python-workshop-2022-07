    "## Data Visualization Helps you Understand and Communicate Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizing data is one of the most important things you can do to better understand the data you're working with.  While looking at tables, computing statistical summaries, fitting models, etc. can give you important insight into a data set, even simple visualizations can often help you to understand data more effectively than other methods.  Anyone who works with data will need to become proficient at producting data visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data visualization is sometimes split into to categories, based on their aims and intended audiences:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exploratory**: data visualizations that are produced in order to help the data analyst understand what's there, how the data is structured, if there are patterns, if there are problems, etc.  Exploratory visualizations are often produced frequently and quickly during the course of an analysis since their aim is to help one understand what might be in the data.\n",
    "- **Explanitory**: data visualizations that are produced in order to convey a message that's represented or supported by the underlying data. Explanitory visualizations are often produced after you understand what's in the data and what message you want to communicate.  Explanitory visualizations usually take longer to make and are more polished than exploratory visualizations.\n",

On the backend, `pandas` uses the `matplotlib` library, and allows you to produce plots by calling methods from `Series` and `DataFrame` objects.
